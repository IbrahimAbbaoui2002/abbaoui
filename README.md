### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd testapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Configure Android**
   - Ensure your `android/app/build.gradle` has minimum SDK version 21

   ```

### Required Permissions

The app requires the following permissions to function properly:

- **Storage**: Read/write files and media
- **Location**: Required for Wi-Fi scanning (Android 6+)
- **Wi-Fi**: Access and modify Wi-Fi state
- **Bluetooth**: For nearby connections and Wi-Fi Direct

   - The app will automatically start in discovery mode

2. **Add Files**
   - Tap the "+" button to add files
   - Choose from Images, Videos, Audio, Documents, or All Files
   - Selected files appear in the main list

3. **Discover Devices**
   - Switch to "Devices" tab
   - Other devices running the app will appear automatically

- Delete individual transfer records

## Configuration

### App Constants
Key configuration options in `lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:

```dart
class AppConstants {
  static const int defaultPort = 8080;
  static const int maxFileSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 2GB
  static const int chunkSize = 64 * 1024; // 64KB
  static const Duration discoveryTimeout = Duration(seconds: 30);
  static const Duration connectionTimeout = Duration(seconds: 10);
}
```

### Customization
- Modify supported file types in `AppConstants`
- Adjust transfer chunk size for performance tuning
- Configure discovery and connection timeouts
- Customize UI theme in `lib/shared/theme/app_theme.dart`

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Manual Testing
1. Install app on two physical Android devices
2. Connect both devices to same Wi-Fi network
3. Test file transfer between devices
4. Verify Wi-Fi Direct functionality
5. Test QR code connection feature

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Denied
- Ensure all permissions are granted in device settings
- Restart app after granting permissions

#### Devices Not Found
- Check Wi-Fi is enabled on both devices
- Ensure devices are on same network
- Try refreshing device discovery

#### Transfer Failed
- Check available storage space
- Verify Wi-Fi connection stability
- Retry with smaller files first

#### Wi-Fi Direct Not Working
- Enable Wi-Fi Direct in device settings
- Clear app cache and restart
- Some devices may not support Wi-Fi Direct

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```dart
const bool kDebugMode = true;
```

## Performance Optimization

### Transfer Speed

- Parallel chunk processing
- Network condition adaptation

### Memory Management
- Streaming file transfer (no full file loading)
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
- Efficient image/video thumbnail generation

### Battery Optimization
- Background transfer with wake locks
- Automatic pause on low battery
- Network-aware transfer scheduling
